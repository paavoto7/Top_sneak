# Sneaker / top_sneak
A very basic and as of now an unfinished 2D-game. The enemy AI is very basic and needs a lot of honing. It wonders aimlessly until the player comes to the cone of vision which is visible in the photo. It then uses a modified BFS and has some heuristics when it tries to hunt the player. The game in general has a state machine type of architecture to make the menus and all work. Made completely in pygame. 

The sprites are not included as many of them are not very good or I don't own the copyright to them. Therefore they are all left out. Adding them requires making a images directory under assets.

## To run
The game is simply run by executing the run.py file. The only requirement is pygame.
